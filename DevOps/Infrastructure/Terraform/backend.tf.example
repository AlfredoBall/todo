/*
Backend configuration example for Terraform remote state in Azure Storage.

IMPORTANT: Variables are NOT allowed in backend blocks. Instead:

1. Use the provided initialization scripts (recommended):
   - PowerShell: .\DevOps\Scripts\terraform-init.ps1
   - Bash: ./DevOps/Scripts/terraform-init.sh
   
   These scripts read environment variables from backend.env (not committed)
   and pass them as -backend-config arguments.

2. OR manually pass backend config at terraform init time:

   terraform init \
     -backend-config="resource_group_name=<your-tfstate-rg>" \
     -backend-config="storage_account_name=<your-storage-account>" \
     -backend-config="container_name=tfstate" \
     -backend-config="key=todo.terraform.tfstate" \
     -backend-config="subscription_id=<your-subscription-id>" \
     -backend-config="tenant_id=<your-tenant-id>"

3. For CI/CD:
   Store these values as pipeline secrets/variables and pass them during init.

Do NOT commit secrets (like access_key) into source control.
Prefer Azure AD authentication with RBAC over storage account keys.

See backend.env.example for environment variable template.
See TERRAFORM.md for detailed setup instructions.
